## 🤖 OpenAI Codex Maintenance & Integration Plan

As a project maintained by a single core developer, utilizing AI to maximize daily maintenance and QA efficiency is a core focus. We are actively experimenting with integrating **OpenAI Codex & API** into the "xiaobao-tools" software lifecycle across four distinct scenarios:

1. **Automated PR Reviews & Intelligent Refactoring (AI Code Review)**:
   Leverages Codex to automatically audit incoming community PR submissions, identifying memory issues, code smells, or style violations, and posting refactored, PEP-8 compliant suggestions directly inside PR comments.
2. **AI-driven Unit Test Generation (AI Test Coverage)**:
   Uses Codex to analyze input/output boundaries of the 20+ standalone scripts and automatically generate `pytest` regression tests inside the `tests/` directory to assure cross-version Windows compatibility.
3. **Smart Issue Triage & Bug Diagnosis (Traceback Analysis)**:
   Feeds user-submitted terminal traceback logs to Codex, automatically extracting environmental details (e.g. OpenCV version, OS version) and auto-assigning tags like `bug` or `os:windows`.
4. **Automated Multilingual Docs Sync (AI Localization)**:
   Extracts code functions to write docstrings using Codex, and keeps the Chinese and English READMEs completely synchronized with zero translation overhead.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HenryYannis/xiaobao-toos.git
cd xiaobao-toos
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
While simple scripts run on Python's standard library, complex multi-media/vision tools require third-party libraries. Install them via:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run a Tool
Execute any Python script directly inside your terminal:
```bash
python productivity/temp_password.py
```
